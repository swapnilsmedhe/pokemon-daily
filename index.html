          Casual trekkers along the Pacific Coast Highway have discovered 3 new species of Pokemon. These
          species had previously only been theorised and this is the first time that any human has seen these
          in the wild. Initial reports suggests that these pokemon are not particularly dangerous and appear
          quit friendly to humans. They seem especially fond of candy. One of the trekkers who spotted
          Bublasaur said:

          This is one of the cutest Pokemon we&apos;ve ever seen. We could not believe we saw something like
          this. This is the happiest day of my life.

          Researchers are elated and cannot wait to find such more hidden Pokemon. Some researchers belive
          over 200 such species exist in the wild.
